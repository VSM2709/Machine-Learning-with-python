## Introduction

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Python has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages for machine learning due to its simplicity, flexibility, and rich ecosystem of libraries.

This repository serves as a learning resource for individuals interested in understanding and applying machine learning techniques using Python. It covers a wide range of topics, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and more.

## Installation

To run the code examples in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, we recommend using virtual environments to manage dependencies. You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific machine learning concept or technique. You can navigate to the respective directory to find code examples, tutorials, and documentation related to that topic.

```bash
cd supervised-learning/linear-regression
python linear_regression.py
```
Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different parameters, and explore further on your own.
